      "Cooking is a craft, I like to think, and a good cook is a craftsman --
      not an artist. There's nothing wrong with that: The great cathedrals of
      Europe were built by craftsmen -- though not designed by them. Practicing
      your craft in expert fashion is noble, honorable, and satisfying."
      -Anthony Bourdain

      Hello. My name is Joseph, but most know me as simply "Chef Joe".
      <i>(Ok, nobody calls me "Chef Joe", but that doesn't matter!!!)</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been cooking since I was around 14 years old. For most of my
      childhood, my mother cooked for us, and I loved her cooking. I wanted to
      try cooking when I was young, which led me down a path ot trying out
      everything culinarily speaking. I've baked, sauteed, boiled, stewed,
      broiled, air fried, and grilled. I'm not a great cook, but I always feel
      happier when I'm working on cooking a new dish, or trying out a new
      technique.
