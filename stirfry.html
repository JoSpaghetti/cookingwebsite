    <h2>Basic Ingredients</h2>

    <p>
      When creating a stir fry, creativity is key. Stir Fry's can be a vessel
      for you to flex your culinary expertise, or an avenue for you to get rid
      of fresh produce sitting in your fridge or countertop. Saying that, there
      are basic ingredients to every stir fry that you have to use.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Protein (chicken, beef, pork, or tofu)</li>
      <li>Aromatics (garlic, onions, cloves, spices, ect)</li>
      <li>Oil (olive oil, butter, ghee, avocado oil, ect.)</li>
      <li>Veggies (brocoli, carrots, onions, mushrooms, snap peas, ect)</li>
      <li>
        Sauce (Soy Sauce, Rice Vinegar [or white vinegar], Sriracha, Mayo)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After gathering your ingredients, you have to move onto the next step...
    </p>

    <h2>Frying and Stirring</h2>

    <p>
      The next step towards making a successful stir fry is getting a wide and
      shallow pan. You want to ensure that your ingredients have as much contact
      as possible with your heat source. When cooking your stir fry, make sure
      to cook everything as flat as possible, which is to say
      <b>DO NOT OVERLAP INGREDIENTS!</b>
      It is far better to cook in several batches instead of overcrowding the
      pan with every ingredient all at once.

      <br />
      <br />
      Cook your ingredients until they start to brown and caramelize. Don't
      overcook them, because your stir fry will burn. Nobody wants burnt stir
      fry! Add in any additional sauces or aromatics here.

      <br />
      <br />
      Now that you've cooked your stir fry, you now need to worry about...
    </p>

    <h2>Serving your Stir Fry</h2>

    <p>
      Now, you can eat your stir fry as is, and it will taste great. To bring
      your stir fry to a different level, you need to focus on plating and side
      dishes. the most popular side dish with stir fry is rice. It works to
      balance out the intense and flavorful tastes that stir fry can have. To
      make your rice more exciting, you can always spice your rice by using
      coconut milk or whole peppercorns.

      <br />
      <br />
      There are other alternatives to rice however. You can use stir fry as an
      addition to a salad or burrito. You can add stir fry to a packet of ramen
      to add some body and complexity to the humble dish. Ultimately, the sky is
      the limit when it comes to the applications that stir fry can be used in.

      <br />
      <br />
      Now, go out there and make some stir fry for yourself!
